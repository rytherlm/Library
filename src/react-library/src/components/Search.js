// genre. The resulting list of books must show the book’s name, the authors, the pub-
// lisher, the length, audience and the ratings. The list must be sorted alphabetically
// (ascending) by book’s name and release date. Users can sort the resulting list: book
// name, publisher, genre, and released year (ascending and descending).
